Advanced
LDAP Authentication cannot be configured without an active dedicated cluster running MongoDB 3.6 or higher.
LDAP Authentication
LDAP authentication allows database users to log into dedicated (M10 or higher) Atlas clusters using credentials that are verified by a LDAP server you control. Database users can be configured in the project-level Access Manager. LDAP authentication is deprecated for MongoDB versions 8.0+. Learn more

Turning on this feature will increase your daily cluster pricing. Read more.


LDAP Authorization (LDAP Authentication required)
LDAP authorization allows database users to be managed at LDAP group level. LDAP groups can be managed in the project-level Access Manager and be assigned a specific set of privileges. All database users in an LDAP group can then authenticate to dedicated (M10 or higher) Atlas clusters with those privileges.

Turning on this feature will increase your daily cluster pricing. Read more.


Encryption at Rest using your Key Management
Provide your AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud KMS encryption key details to enable Encryption at Rest with the WiredTiger™ Encrypted Storage Engine.

Newly deployed clusters will use your encryption key by default. Pre-existing clusters will not use your encryption key until you enable them individually. This feature will increase your daily cluster pricing. Read more.

Atlas automatically rotates MongoDB master encryption keys every 90 days during user-configurable maintenance window. Read more.


Database Auditing
Database auditing allows you to customize log downloads with the users, groups, and actions you want to audit.

Turning on this feature will increase your daily cluster pricing. Read more.


Streams Auditing
Streams auditing records changes to your stream processors, as well as authentication events you want to audit.

This feature is included in the cost of your stream processor.


Push-Based Log Export
Allows you to configure Atlas to automatically export database logs to an AWS S3 bucket.

Exporting logs may incur data transfer costs. Read more.


Self-managed X.509 Authentication
With self-managed X.509 authentication, you can configure Atlas to trust your public key infrastructure and issue certificates to users yourself. Read more
