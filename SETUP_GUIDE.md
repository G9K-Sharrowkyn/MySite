# Navigate to your project
cd "F:\Teksty\Programming\Site1\my-site"

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up Environment**
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file if needed (optional for local testing)
```

#### **Step 3: Start the Application**

**Option A: Run Both Servers Separately (Recommended)**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend Server
cd backend
node server.js

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend Server (in new terminal)

```

#### **Step 4: Access Your Website**
